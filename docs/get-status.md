### Checking the Status of a Payment

To check the status of a payment, follow these steps:

1. **Call the Payment Status Endpoint**:
   Use the following endpoint to retrieve the payment status:
   [Payment Status Endpoint](https://docs.belong.net/#7a666068-9ddb-4fac-a8dc-4d5c239f8692)

2. **Interpret the Response**:
   - If the endpoint returns an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) object, this indicates that the payment was successful.
   - If the response does not include an NFT object, the payment might have failed or is still being processed. Further investigation may be required based on the returned data.

For more details on the parameters and possible responses, refer to the official documentation linked above.
